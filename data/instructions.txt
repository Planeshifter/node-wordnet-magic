The package expects the WordNet database in SQLite format in this directory.
A current version can be obtained from the URL http://sourceforge.net/projects/wnsql/files/wnsql3/sqlite/.
As of time of writing, the latest version is 3.1, such that the file of the database should be sqlite-31.db. 
If for whatever reason the name of your file differs from sqlite-31.db, you have to register the database after loading the package by invoking the
registerDatabase(path) function at startup, which expects the path of the database as its first argument.
